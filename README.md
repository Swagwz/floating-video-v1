# Picture in Picture with controls
This is a google extension combine [Picture-in-Picture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API) & [Media Session API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Session_API) to make the floating window controllable.<br>
Here is the [google extension page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/picture-in-picture-with-c/dfipjlkcgbenndhgliggacdpplelplei)
## How to use
![screen1](img/screen1.png)
Download the extension and click it, a popup page will shown like above screen shot<br>
You can customize your forward/backward second and playbacke speed<br>
Press **[PLAY]** button if all setting are done.
![screen2](img/screen2.png)
<img src="img/previous.png" alt="previous" width="20"/> <img src="img/next.png" alt="next" width="20"/> are seek forward/backward<br>
<img src="img/microphone-black-shape.png" alt="microphone" width="20"/> is control of playback speed<br>
Using these such not intuitive icons is because Media Session API's some action didn't shown on PIP window<br>
What I can do is to choose other action to make icon shown so now is controllable
